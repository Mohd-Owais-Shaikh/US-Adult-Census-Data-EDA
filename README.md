# US-Adult-Census-Data-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of US Adult Census Income Data 1997

We acquired a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our dataset is a Census Income Data Set, also known as the "Adult" dataset, which was originally extracted from the census bureau database found at http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html. This dataset has both continuous and discrete instances and was initially used to develop an machine learning algorithm to predict the income range of a person.
